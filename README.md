# 8d-Cistercian-Lattice-DAG-all-unicode-code-points-114111
In this updated code, I modified the main function to encrypt a message containing all the 114111 possible Unicode symbols as code points. The message is generated by looping through each code point and converting it to a character. The encrypted message is then outputted.
